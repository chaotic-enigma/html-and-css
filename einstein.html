<h1>Albert Einstein</h1>
  <div>
<p class="sub1">The man who developed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity"target="_blank">Theory of relativity</a>, one of the two pillars of modern physics and whose works mainly influenced on the philosophy of science.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p class="timeline">Here's the timeline of Dr.Albert Einstein's life...</p></div>
  <div>
<ul>
  <div class="years">
  <li>1879: 14 March in Ulm, Germany.</li>
  <li>1880: Family moved to Munich, where Einstein's father and his uncle Jakob founded Electrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current.</li>
<li>1894: Hermann and Jakob's company lost a bid to supply the city of Munich with electrical lighting because they lacked the capital to convert their equipment from direct current (DC) standard to the more efficient alternating current (AC) standard.</li>
<li>1895-96: To complete his secondary schooling while lodging with the family of professor Jost Winteler, he fell in love with Winteler's daughter, Marie.</li>
<li>1896: He passed the Swiss Matura with mostly good grades, including a top grade of 6 in physics and mathematical subjects, on aaq scale of 1-6.</li>
<li>1900: He was awrded the Zurich Polytechnic teaching diploma, but Maric failed the examination with a poor grade in mathematics component, theory of functions. His paper "Folgerungen aus den Capillaritatsercheinungen" was published in the journal "Annalen der Physik".</li>
    <li>1902: He started a small discussion group, self-mockingly named "The Olympia Academy", which met regularly to discuss science and philosophy.Their readings included the works of Henri Poincare Ernst Mach and David Hume, ahich influenced his scientific and philosophical outlook.</li>
    <li>1903: He and Maric married in the month of January.</li>
<li>1904: In may they were blessed with their first son, Hans Albert Einstein, born in Bern, Switzerland.</li>
    <li>1905: On 30 April 1905, Einstein completed his thesis with Alfred Kleiner,Professor of Experimental Physics, serving as pro-forma advidor.</li>

  <li>1909: Einstein was appointed associate professor.</li>

    <li>1911: Einstein became a full professor at the German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague in April.</li>
  <li>1912-14: He was professor of theoritical physics at ETH Zurich, where he taught analytical mechanics and thermodynamics.</li>
  <li>1916: He was appointed president of the German Physical Society (1916-18).</li>
  <li>1919: That prediction was confirmed by Sir Arthur Eddington during the solar eclipse of 29 May 1919.

    <li>1920: He became a Foreign Member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.</li>
  <li>1922: He was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to Theoritical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the Law of Photoelectric effect".</li>
  <li>1925: He received the Coley Medal from the Royal Society.</li>
  <li>1935: Elsa Einstein was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems; she died in December 1936.</li>
  <li>1939: A group of Hungarian scientists that included emigre physicist Leo Szilard attempted to alert Wshington to Ongoing Nazi atomic bomb research.</li>
  <li>1955: Einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, shich had previously been reinforced surgically by Rudolph Nissen in 1948.</li>
  <li>1965: In his lecture, Oppenheimer noted that Einstein's early writings were riddled with errors which had already delayed their publication for almost ten years: "A man whose errors can take that long to correct is quite a man."</li>
     <li>1987: The discovery and publication of an early correspondence between Einstein and Maric revealed that they had had a daughter, called Lieseri in their letters, born in early 1902.</li>
